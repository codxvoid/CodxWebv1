> CodxVoid : Code Infinite, Think Void

## The Evolution of CodxVoid

CodxVoid, originally named **CodzLab**, underwent a transformation to better represent its core values of **infinity** and **freedom** in the world of coding and technology.

### Why the Change?

When the project was initially started under the name "CodzLab," the focus was on creating a collaborative space for coders and developers. However, as the vision grew, we realized the name didnâ€™t fully encapsulate the limitless possibilities we wanted to promote. 

"CodxVoid" emerged as a more fitting representation of our mission:
- **"Cod"** symbolizes the foundation of our community: coding and development.
- **"x"** represents the **infinity symbol**, signifying limitless possibilities, innovation, and continuous growth.
- **"Void"** embodies the concept of **freedom and openness**, creating an unrestricted environment where ideas can flow freely and creativity knows no bounds.

Thus, CodzLab evolved into CodxVoid, marking a new chapter in our journey towards a more inclusive, expansive, and innovative platform for the future of technology and development.

We are excited to embark on this new phase with the community and continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of coding!
